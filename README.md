## Description

This library application is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) Javascript course. It notably uses javascript constructor functions to create _book_ objects and also utilizes object prototype methods to manipulate data.

Additionally, this application uses local browser storage for persistent data without needing a database.
